1) what is on-premise? give example
On-premise - here the machine and software is installed locally, in a physical location and we need to maintain on our own.
and it requires a infrastructure and we need to setup environment
everything will be controlled and managed by ourselvs
i.e
application	virtualization
data		servers
runtime		storage
middleware	networking
os(oper systm)

------------------------------------------------------------------
2) what is cloud? give example
machines and softwares are installed in different region and we access the servers over the internet.

example: there are multiple service providers like 
-aws by amazone
-azure by microsoft
-Google cloud by google

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3) what is server?
server is a computer machine, which has compute power and storage capability

example: ec2 instances(ealstic compute cloud)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4) what are the cloud servicess?
ans:
 Infrastructure as survice (IaaS)
 Platform as a service (PaaS) 
 Software as a service (SaaS) 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
5) what is IAAS PAAS SAAS? 
 Infrastructure as survice (IaaS):
 ---------------------------------
 In Iaas the service provider will provide infrastructure as a service and  it's type of cloud computing service that offers  servers,
 storage, and networking resources on demand.
 
	here, user will be an architect.
 example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and DigitalOcean.
 
 Platform as a service (PaaS): 
------------------------------
 In Pass the service provider will provide platform as a service and user needs to manage code to develop application and data. 
 and runtime, middleware, os, vitualization, server, storage and networking will be managed by service providers.

	here, user will be like a developer
 Example: playstore is platform on which we build application.
			(software tools to users over the internet. Usually, these tools are needed for application development)
			
 Software as a service (SaaS): 
 -----------------------------
 In Saas, the service provider will provide software as service which allows users to connect to it and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. 
 
 here, user will be end user.
 Examples: Google Drive, one drive, email, gira
 
(SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Diff between service and resource?
 The resource is the “thing” the service is “what it does”
 a resource is an entity that you can work with
 
 example:
 ec2 service and instance resource
 s3	is a service and bucket resource

7) what is regions?
 region is separate geographical area, where the cloud setup is done.

8) what is availability zone.?
 each region has multiple isolated locations known as availability zones.

9) on what basis you will select region.?
 It depends on where the no of users of my application is more.
 
10) what is IAM?
With AWS Identity and Access Management, we can specify who can access services and resources in AWS

11) why s3 is global in aws?
 Amazon S3 supports global buckets, 
 which means that each bucket name must be unique across all AWS accounts in all the AWS Regions within a partition. 
 (A partition is a grouping of Regions)

12) how will you create iam user?
we create users and assign necessary permissions to them in the form of policies
users --> adduser --> 	username
			Access key - Programmatic access (or the AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools.)
			Password - AWS Management Console access
			
		--->autogenarate password
			custom password

then, Next permission	--> Add user to group, Copy permissions from existing user, Attach existing policies directly
			(select "add user to group" and select existing "Group")
then, next: tag		enter the "key" and "value" 
then, next: review	review it
then, create user


13)	a) what is roles?
	b) why roles requered?

14) what is assume roles?
	
15) a) what is policies? 
	b) what are different types of policies?


16) what is cloudwatch?
	Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications .
	it monitors AWS resources  EC2 instances, DynamoDB tables,
	
17) what is metrix? and what are the parameters you pass?
	Performence of a perticular resorce based on parameters like cpu utilization, disk_free
		eg: we need to select the resource(EC2) type of pre defined mertrix which we need to moniter (eg: CPU usage)

18) a) What alaram? 
		survice by Aws it triggers a notification when a Metrix fall outside the given range
		Ex:
		If CPU utilization goes beyond the static threshold alarm goes to alarm state 
		Three states in CW Alarm:
		Alarm state
		Insufficient 
		OK state 
	
19)  what is SNS?
	Simple Notification Service is a notification service provided by Amazon Web Service. 

20) what is topic and subscription?
	 SNS topic is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel
	 End users who subscribe to the topic.

21) explain pub-sub model?

	Application-to-application (A2A)
	Publisher -->  Aws SNS --> subscribers (Aws lamda , Aws Sqs,http/s)
	
	Application-to-person (A2P)
	
	Publisher --> Aws SNS--> subscribers ( push Notification ,Text Messages,Email)
	

22) What is diff betn FIFO and Standard queue?
First-in-first-out delivery, message ordering is preserved
Exactly-once processing

Statnderd 

At-least-once delivery, message ordering isn't preserved
Best-effort ordering

23) what is SQS service?
	Simple Queue Service 
 SQS has two types of queues: FIFO and Standard and they are focused on the successful delivery and processing of messages by individual
24) what is SNS service?

	Simple Notification service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers

26) what is cloudtrail?
		used to track user acitivities and API services.
	•	Auditing tool records all AWS account activity. 
	•	Any action taken by users, roles and AWS services are recorded to cloud trial.
	•	Cloud trial events are kept for 90 days in event history 
	•	You can create a trail of your own store the event history in s3 bucket
27) what are the main classification in cloudtrail?
	•	There are two types of event 
Management events: Management operations performed on AWS 
Data events : create or modifying data in Database it supports S3 bucket and dynamo Db server. 
Insights events: unusual activity will be tracked.
